# Final-Project

This content was created by Kaelyn Sakai. The project aims to analyze popular music and the various components that they are comprised of. By answering the research question, **"What types of songs were the most popular in the 2010's and can correlations be drawn between the different variables that contribute to the song popularity?"**, I hope to explore music and understand more about what makes a trending song.
